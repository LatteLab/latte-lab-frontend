## Member Portal

### Event Catalog (`/user/events`)

Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns). Each card:

- Cover image (16:9, rounded, hover scale)
- Date (muted accent, e.g. "SAT, MAR 15"), name (bold, tight tracking), location
- Status badge: "Open" (green), "Waitlist" (amber), "Lottery Open" (purple), "Lottery Closed" (gray)
- Subtle shadow, lift on hover

Top bar: search input + filter (All / Upcoming / Past).

### Event Detail (`/user/events/[id]`)

Two-column on desktop, stacking on mobile.

**Left:** Cover image (square, rounded-2xl), host info.

**Right:**

- Name (text-3xl, font-bold, tight tracking)
- Date/time with calendar icon
- Location with map pin
- Capacity indicator with progress bar ("12 / 20 spots")
- Primary action button (full-width, rounded-xl):
  - Waitlist with spots: "RSVP"
  - Waitlist full: "Join Waitlist"
  - Lottery before deadline: "Enter Lottery" + countdown
  - Lottery after deadline: "Lottery Closed" (disabled)
  - Already registered: "You're In" with cancel option
  - Selected from lottery: "You've Been Selected"
- Description
- Guest list (stacked avatars + "+N more")

Mobile: single column, sticky CTA at bottom with backdrop blur.

### Member Directory (`/user/directory`)

Search bar + grid/list of member cards (avatar, name, class year, major). Click for full profile. Client-side filtering.

### Member Profile (`/user/directory/[id]`)

Read-only: avatar, name, class year, major, bio, interests, contact info.

### Edit Profile (`/user/profile`)

Form to edit own fields: major, class year, phone, interests, bio, location. Server action to update users table.

## Admin Event Management

### Event List (`/admin/events`)

Table: Name, Date, Type, Status, Registration count. Click to manage.

### Event Creation (`/admin/events/new`)

Single-page form, Luma-style sidebar layout.

**Sidebar (~320px):**

- Cover image upload (drag-and-drop, dashed border)
- Event type selector (Waitlist / Lottery radio)
- Lottery deadline picker (shown when Lottery selected)
- Status toggle (Draft / Publish)

**Main area:**

- Event name (large borderless input, text-3xl)
- Date/time pickers (start + optional end)
- Location input
- Capacity input
- Description textarea

### Event Management (`/admin/events/[id]`)

**Overview:** Edit event details (same form, pre-filled).

**Registrations:** Table of all registrations (name, email, status, registered at, priority score for lottery). Admin can remove or change status. For lottery events: "Run Lottery" button.

**Lottery draw flow:**

1. Click "Run Lottery" -> confirmation dialog
2. Compute priority: 1.0 base + 0.5 per past loss - 1.0 per past no-show
3. Weighted random selection for N spots (capacity)
4. Review screen: Winners / Not Selected
5. "Confirm Results" to finalize (update statuses, write lottery_history)

### Check-in Mode (`/admin/events/[id]/checkin`)

Mobile-optimized, full-screen. Designed for admins at the door.

- Top: event name + counter ("14 / 20 checked in") + progress bar
- Auto-focused search bar
- Alphabetical list of confirmed attendees
- Each row: avatar, name, tap-to-toggle (green checkmark when checked in)
- Large tap targets (48px min)
- "Close Event" button: confirms "mark unchecked as no-show?", bulk updates, sets event to completed

### Attendance Analytics

Dashboard stat cards: Total Events, Average Attendance Rate, No-Show Rate.

User detail page (`/admin/users/[id]`): events attended, no-show count, lottery win/loss, attendance history list.

## Design Style

Luma-inspired, clean and professional:

- Dark mode default
- Rounded-2xl corners on cards and images
- Subtle shadows (`shadow-[0_20px_60px_-2.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.05)]`)
- Tight letter-spacing on headings
- Backdrop blur on sticky elements
- Muted accent colors for dates and secondary info
- Large, rounded action buttons
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components with Tailwind customization

---

## Architecture

- Server components for pages
- Server actions for mutations (register, run lottery, check-in, profile updates, event CRUD)
- Drizzle ORM queries for reads
- Client components only for interactive parts (search, filters, forms)
- No API routes needed
